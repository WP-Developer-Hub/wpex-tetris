## Gallery & Lightbox
The default WordPress gallery and caption styling are intentionally basic for flexibility.
For a modern gallery slider, see the [demo](https://pressthemes.freesite.host/portfolio/lightning-fast-rom.html).
> **Recommended:**
> For best gallery slider results, install [Simple Lightbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-lightbox/).
> Without it, the gallery slider may not look or function as intended.

## Sidebar on Pages
By default, **pages do not have a sidebar or title** for a clean look.
> **Want sidebar support on pages?**
> Use this branch:
> [SidebarOnPagesWithToggle](https://github.com/WP-Developer-Hub/wpex-tetris/tree/SidebarOnPagesWithToggle)
> This branch adds a toggle to enable or disable the sidebar on pages.
>
> If you’d like this feature in the main branch, [open an issue or ticket](https://github.com/WP-Developer-Hub/wpex-tetris/issues) and I’ll consider merging it.
